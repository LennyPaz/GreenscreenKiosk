# Green Screen Kiosk Design Analysis

## 1. What We Liked About the Original Design

- Clear step-by-step workflow
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Background preview system
- Dual-purpose receipt (customer + operator)
- Numbered progress indicators
- Webcam customer identification
- Auto-print receipt functionality
- Price display visible to users

## 2. What We Disliked About the Original Design

- **Information overload**: Page 2 crammed 8+ decisions onto one screen
- **Inconsistent visual design**: Clashing colors (cyan, red, green, gray) with no unified theme
- **Poor layout**: Random element positioning, buried important information
- **Confusing pricing**: Showed intermediate calculations alongside final price
- **No validation or guidance**: Users could make mistakes without feedback
- **Dated aesthetics**: Low contrast, generic clipart, inconsistent typography
- **Unclear navigation**: Inconsistent button positions, no clear emergency exit

## 3. Sources & User Testing

**Research Foundation**: Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

**User Testing**: None conducted on either version. Improvements based on heuristic evaluation and kiosk interface best practices.

## 4. What We Kept from Original Design

- Webcam customer identification
- Auto-print receipt system
- Dual receipt (customer + operator sections)
- Core user flow (welcome → background → options → details → photo → receipt)
- Party size selection (1-10+)
- Background preview system
- Multi-email delivery
- Print quantity selection
- Multiple payment methods
- Customer ID numbers

## 5. What We Added to the Design

**Visual Design**
- Modern gradient color system (purple/pink primary theme)
- Glassmorphism effects (frosted glass UI elements)
- Consistent design system with CSS variables
- Professional typography hierarchy

**User Experience**
- One decision per screen (reduced cognitive load)
- Real-time floating price tracker
- Interactive progress bar with clickable navigation
- Consistent Back/Start Over buttons on every screen
- Visual selection feedback (green checkmarks)
- Confirmation screen before finalizing

**Technical**
- No-scroll viewport (everything fits on screen)
- Database integration for transaction storage
- State management with session persistence
- Backend API architecture
- Config-driven system for operator customization

**Functionality**
- On-screen keyboard with email domain shortcuts
- Real-time email validation
- Dynamic screen flow based on selections
- Transaction analytics and reporting

## 6. Help Guide

**Current Status**: No help guide exists

**Recommended Solution**: Contextual help toggle system
- Question mark (?) button in header on all screens
- Tap to enter "help mode"
- Pulsing indicators appear on all interactive elements
- Tap any element to see its explanation tooltip
- Auto-dismiss after 30 seconds or manual exit

**Benefits**: Non-intrusive, touch-friendly, provides help exactly when needed

## 7. Usability Heuristics - NEW Changes Only

**1. Visibility of System Status**
- Real-time floating price tracker that updates with selections
- Interactive progress bar showing current step
- Visual feedback on selections (green checkmarks)

**2. Match Between System and Real World**
- Natural conversational language ("What's your name?" not "Enter Identifier")

**3. User Control and Freedom**
- Consistent Back and Start Over buttons on every screen
- Clickable progress bar to jump to previous steps
- No dead ends in navigation

**4. Consistency and Standards**
- Unified design system with CSS variables
- Consistent button styling and positioning across all screens
- Predictable interaction patterns (tap to select, green = selected)

**5. Error Prevention**
- One decision per screen to reduce cognitive load
- Real-time email validation
- Disabled "Continue" buttons until valid input
- Confirmation screen before finalizing

**6. Recognition Rather Than Recall**
- Persistent price display (always visible)
- On-screen keyboard with email domain shortcuts
- Confirmation screen shows all previous selections

**7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**
- Email domain shortcuts (.com, .edu, .org) for faster input
- Jump to previous steps via progress bar
- Config-driven system for operator customization

**8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**
- One decision per screen (vs. original's 8+ decisions on one screen)
- Clean modern gradient design system
- Progressive disclosure (show email fields only when needed)

**9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**
- Basic validation feedback implemented
- *Status: Needs improvement - should add plain language error messages*

**10. Help and Documentation**
- *Status: Not yet implemented - contextual help system recommended (see Section 6)*
