!IMPORTANT NOTE! If there is objectively better way to do something then that should be explored.

Specific requirements for the greenscreen system:

The kiosk screen is touch screen only, and while it has a keyboard, that must be used only where necessary and needs to shy away from keyboard use as much as possible. The kiosk should try to limit text on the screen to the extent possible

The kiosk also needs to:
-Look as inviting and fun as can be
-Have a final screen that prints out the receipt, and shows the user how and where to access it and what to do from there
-Only be in English

 

The user must be able to do the following:

-Choose a background
-See a preview the background
-Select a custom background and provide instructions on how to use it
-Choose a payment method (check, cash, debit, credit card)
-Select how many people will be in the picture
-Choose if they want the photo sent to them digitally or printed out
-Choose how many email addresses they want the photo sent to (up to five at least)
-Choose how many prints they want
-Enter the name of their party (or themselves)
-Enter up to as many email addresses as they’ve chosen

 

The following must be modular and are controlled by an outside config file that the operator sets up in advance:
-Price (can be free)
-Method of payment
-Method of delivery
-The maximum amount of prints / emails
-Background pictures to choose from
-Background event theme name

 

It must print a receipt that has two parts. Part one is for the customer to keep, and must contain the following:
-Thier name
-The name of the event (As set by the config file)
-The time they took the picture (assume the system will do that automatically)
-The date they took the picture (assume the system will do that automatically)
-How many prints they’ve chosen
-How many emails they’ve chosen
-What method of payment they’ve selected
-A spot for the camera operator to stamp showing that they’ve paid
-Instructions for them to come back at the end of the night to pick up their prints
-A spot for an attendant to stamp showing they’ve received their prints
-Instructions on what to do if they don’t receive their email within 2 business days and where to email
-A spot for questions and concerns, as well as a hotline to call
-A customer number that is assigned by the system.

 

The second part of the receipt is for the cameraman to keep for records, and does not need to look good at all, just have data on it.
-Name of customer
-Method of delivery
-Time
-Date
-number of people in piocture
-Background number
-Email addresses
-Number of emails to send
-Number of prints
-A place for the camera operator to write notes
-A VERY LARGE number that represents which picture they are

 

It also needs five large places to stamp to verify that they have
-Paid
-Emails have been sent
-Pictures have been printed
-They have picked up their pictures
-They have taken their picture

 

Your design may also include a way for the user to take a picture of themselves, and a way to confirm and store that picture. This may be necessary unless you can come up with another way to match the user to their final photo. (Note that this picture is just for identifying them and can be taken with a webcam or something. The actual final green screen photo is still taken with a nice camera and effects)
