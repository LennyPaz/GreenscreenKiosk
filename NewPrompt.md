# Greenscreen Kiosk Refactor & Design Excellence

## Project Context
You're building a professional greenscreen photo kiosk system for a UX class project. Review these files for full context:
- `10 Usability Heuristics` - Nielsen's 10 heuristics we must follow
- `Project Requirements` - All required features and constraints
- `css_best_practices.md` - CSS standards to follow
- `Group Sprint 3` (rubric PDF) - Grading criteria (105 points total)

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. File Cleanup & Restructuring
**DELETE these unnecessary files:**
- All markdown files EXCEPT `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- `index.html` (the old test page)
- `kiosk.html` and `kiosk-simple.html` (outdated versions)
- `src/components/` directory (using single HTML file approach now)
- `src/utils/` directory (everything is in kiosk.js now)
- `src/app.js` (merged into kiosk.js)

**KEEP these essential files:**
- `start-here.html` (main entry point)
- `src/kiosk.js` (all JavaScript)
- `src/styles/` (will be consolidated)
- `public/config.txt` and `public/backgrounds/`
- `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`

### 2. Consolidate CSS
**Merge all CSS files into ONE file: `src/style.css`**

Current structure:
```
src/styles/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reset.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utilities.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.css
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.css (just imports)
```

**New structure:** Single `src/style.css` with clear sections:
```css
/* ============================================
   1. CSS VARIABLES
   ============================================ */
:root { ... }

/* ============================================
   2. RESET & BASE
   ============================================ */
*, *::before, *::after { ... }

/* ============================================
   3. COMPONENTS
   ============================================ */
.btn { ... }
.card { ... }

/* ============================================
   4. UTILITIES
   ============================================ */
.flex { ... }

/* ============================================
   5. APP SPECIFIC
   ============================================ */
#app { ... }
```

Delete the `src/styles/` folder after consolidation.

### 3. Update File Structure
**Final structure should be:**
```
Greenscreen Sprint/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start-here.html          ‚Üê Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kiosk.js            ‚Üê All JavaScript (keep as-is)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css           ‚Üê Consolidated CSS (create this)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.txt          ‚Üê Configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backgrounds/        ‚Üê Background images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               ‚Üê User documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md              ‚Üê Development notes
```

### 4. Update CLAUDE.md
Rewrite `CLAUDE.md` as a comprehensive development reference containing:

**Section 1: Design Requirements**
- Summary of 10 Usability Heuristics and how we apply them
- Touch-first design principles (80px minimum targets)
- Accessibility requirements
- Visual design goals ("professional, modern, worth thousands")

**Section 2: Technical Architecture**
- File structure explanation
- How state management works
- Config-driven design approach
- Screen flow logic

**Section 3: Implementation Checklist**
- ‚úÖ Completed features
- üîÑ In-progress features
- ‚ùå TODO features

**Section 4: CSS Best Practices Applied**
- BEM naming convention examples
- CSS variables usage
- DRY principles in action
- Component reusability

**Section 5: Rubric Alignment**
- Map each rubric criterion to our implementation
- Note areas needing improvement for full points

**Section 6: Customer Needs from Requirements**
- List all "user must be able to" requirements
- Check off what's implemented
- Note what's still needed

## Design Excellence Goal

### Vision Statement
Create a **premium, professional greenscreen kiosk** that looks like it cost thousands of dollars. Think Apple Store aesthetic meets modern photo booth. This should feel:
- ‚ú® Delightful and inviting
- üéØ Intuitive (grandma test: can she use it?)
- üöÄ Smooth and polished
- üíé High-end and trustworthy
- üé® Visually stunning

### Design Inspiration
Aim for the quality level of:
- Apple's checkout kiosks
- Modern photo booth companies (Snapbar, Pixilated, Simple Booth)
- Premium event technology
- Contemporary SaaS web apps (Linear, Notion, Stripe)

### Key Design Principles

**Visual Design:**
- **Modern color palette** - Vibrant gradients, depth, not flat
- **Generous whitespace** - Don't cram everything
- **Bold typography** - Clear hierarchy, readable from distance
- **Playful animations** - Micro-interactions that delight
- **Card-based layouts** - Elevated, shadowed components
- **Photography-focused** - Showcase the backgrounds beautifully

**Interaction Design:**
- **Immediate feedback** - Every tap has a response
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed per step
- **Forgiving** - Easy undo, confirm destructive actions
- **Encouraging** - Positive language, celebrate progress
- **Fast** - No unnecessary delays or loading

**Emotional Impact:**
- First impression: "Wow, this is professional!"
- During use: "This is easy and fun!"
- After: "That was a great experience!"

### Specific Visual Elements to Include

**Welcome Screen:**
- Animated hero element (maybe floating photo frames?)
- Gradient background with subtle pattern
- Glassmorphism effect on cards
- Pulsing/glowing call-to-action button
- Trust indicators (# of photos taken today, reviews, etc.)

**Throughout:**
- Smooth screen transitions (slide, fade, scale)
- Progress indicator with satisfying animations
- Success states with confetti or celebration
- Loading states that are interesting, not boring
- Hover/press states on all interactive elements
- Sound design (optional, toggle-able)

**Typography:**
- Large, bold headings (48px+)
- Clear hierarchy (3-4 sizes max)
- Generous line height for readability
- Mix of weights (regular, semibold, bold)

**Color Usage:**
- Primary: Eye-catching but not overwhelming
- Secondary: Complementary accent
- Success: Celebration moments
- Neutral: Sophisticated grays, not boring
- Gradients: Subtle, tasteful, modern

**Spacing:**
- Consistent 8px grid system
- Breathing room around all elements
- Group related items, separate unrelated
- White space as a design element, not leftover

### Technical Excellence

- Smooth 60fps animations
- Optimized images
- Minimal reflows/repaints

**Polish:**
- No rough edges or placeholder content

## Notes for Claude

- **Be opinionated about design** - Make it beautiful!
- **Follow heuristics religiously** - Document which ones apply where
- **Think like a designer** - Not just functional, but delightful
- **Progressive enhancement** - Start simple, add polish
- **Mobile-first thinking** - Even though it's a kiosk
- **Test as you go** - Open in browser frequently
- **Commit to excellence** - This should be portfolio-worthy

Remember: We're not just building a kiosk, we're building the BEST kiosk. Make it something you'd be proud to show off.

Ready to build something amazing? Start with Phase 1 (file cleanup and consolidation), then let's make each screen spectacular.
